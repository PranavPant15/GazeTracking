# GazeTracking
This code continuously captures frames from the webcam, analyzes the gaze direction using the GazeTracking class, and annotates the frames with information about the detected gaze direction and pupil coordinates. It displays the annotated frames in a window named "Demo" until the user presses the "Escape" key to exit the program.
